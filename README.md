## 3. Project Description/Outline: ##
We will be considering factors such as household income, race, rural vs. urban cities, teacher salary, school funding, pregnancy rate, the school’s Title I status, standardized test scores, and specific education legislation like the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and DREAM Act.
